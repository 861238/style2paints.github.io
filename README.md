In fact, I agree with you. I also think these contents (not selected by me, it is from a test sketch dataset without cherry-pick) seems not very formal for a machine learning post. If we submit something to some formal conferences, we will carefully select the proper content. But what is very very important is that this is just the real market and what users need. 

The biggest(maybe) painting community in the world is called Pixiv, and billions (maybe?) of professional artists works every day on it. Here are some screenshots of the ranking page, where we can see what people really need and what is the best paintings in real market. Notice that it is very hard to make a painting showed in this page (maybe as hard as getting 50000+ stars in one of your GitHub repo, if you are a programmer).

Screenshots of recent best paintings in the Pixiv painting community, the biggest painting community in the world:

As you can see, the content structure of our results and real market demands are same. And I think all of these are professional because the artists are the most professional artists in the world.
